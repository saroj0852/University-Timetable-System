final set of conditions for your university timetable generator, combining all your rules clearly:

1. Teacher Rules

Each teacher must take exactly 3 theory classes per week per section.

If a teacher takes the 12–1 slot, they cannot take 2–3 on the same day (recess rule).

A teacher cannot be assigned to overlapping classes in different sections.

Teacher workload should be balanced across the week.

2. Section Rules

Each section can have a maximum of 4 theory classes per day.

Theory classes must be in continuous blocks:

2-class block: 9–11, 10–12, 2–4, 3–5

3-class block: 9–12, 10–1, 2–5

4-class block: 9–1 (continuous) or 9–11 + 3–5 (split)

Each section has 2–4 labs per week (user-defined).

Labs always occupy 2-hour continuous slots (e.g., 9–11, 11–1, 3–5) and may be split into groups.

3. Room Rules

Each classroom/lab can host only one section at a time.

No room overlaps across sections or departments.

Sections can have allotted classrooms; a room can serve up to 2 sections, but never at the same time.

4. Scheduling & Sequence Rules

Labs are scheduled first, because they require bigger blocks.

Theory classes are scheduled in continuous blocks (as per 2–4 above).

No consecutive 12–1 & 2–3 theory classes for any teacher (recess respected).

Teacher assignments and room allocations cannot overlap.

Teacher load and section schedules should be evenly distributed across the week.

5. Output
